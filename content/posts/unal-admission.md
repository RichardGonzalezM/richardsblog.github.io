## Some context

When we get closer to finishing high school, a very important decision comes to mind... what the hell am I going to do with the rest of my life.

A lot of `Colombian` high school graduates have a dream or goal: to be accepted into the National University of Colombia.

## My experience

### First try (I know, not very motivating)

So I had that dream too. When I was in tenth grade, I began preparing myself thanks to the advices of my cousin who was a student at UNAL.

A year passed, and it was the day of the admmition exam. I arrived with high expectations and a little confident. But when I began to answer the exam, holly cow, it was hard to realize that I might not make it. That made me really nervous; I was more focused on the ticking clock than the actual questions. I felt like my mind disconnected in that moment, and I ended up not finishing all the sections.

### Second and final try

Like I thought, I didn't make it, so I ended up enrolling in another public college. The semester passed, and I learned a lot. One day, I found out that registrations were opening at the National University, so I decided to give it one last shot. This time around, I finished the exam – no more leaving it halfway through like last time!

Waiting for the results was kind of stressful, but when they finally came, I felt a few moments of excitement. Then I realized that it's just the first and easiest step of this long journey. I grounded myself, without undermining the achievement.

## My advice

A lot of folks have taken many more tries to make it, while others have nailed it on the first attempt. My advice is, if you really want it, commit—not just for the final year, but for two or three. (well, maybe if you're a geniuse you don't neet to)

Another point is that this isn't the only decent university in the country. It's not the end of the world if you don't make it. I truly believe that the real game-changer is yourself.

In the end, what truly matters is the effort you put in, the lessons you learn along the way, and the growth you experience, regardless of the outcome. So, keep pushing forward, keep learning, and keep striving for your dreams.

## Some context

When we get closer to finishing high school, a very important decision comes to mind... what the hell am I going to do with the rest of my life.

A lot of `Colombian` high school graduates have a dream or goal: to be accepted into the National University of Colombia.

## My experience

### First try (I know, not very motivating)

So I had that dream too. When I was in tenth grade, I began preparing myself thanks to the advices of my cousin who was a student at UNAL.

A year passed, and it was the day of the admmition exam. I arrived with high expectations and a little confident. But when I began to answer the exam, holly cow, it was hard to realize that I might not make it.

      <description>Some context When we get closer to finishing high school, a very important decision comes to mind&amp;hellip; what the hell am I going to do with the rest of my life.
A lot of Colombian high school graduates have a dream or goal: to be accepted into the National University of Colombia.
My experience First try (I know, not very motivating) So I had that dream too. When I was in tenth grade, I began preparing myself thanks to the advices of my cousin who was a student at UNAL.</description>
